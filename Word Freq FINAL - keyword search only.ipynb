Angela used to manually sift through Annex Reviews documents from our stakeholders, a task that was quite time-consuming, especially for lengthy documents spanning a hundred pages. I helped to streamline this process by developing a Python script to analyze the frequency of specific terms or phrases within the documents. This automation not only saves time but also enhances the accuracy of our document review processes, ensuring stakeholders adhere to correct templates and consistent terminology."],"metadata":{"id":"u6eUNLBM27V3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**1. install packages**"],"metadata":{"id":"W5wH1pswZgnw"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install pymupdf python-docx"],"metadata":{"id":"N8A6l7adPOCN","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1712255791115,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":18850,"user":{"displayName":"Diana Ir - CDPHE","userId":"15359322590399448091"}},"outputId":"c66e290f-2c12-4637-aad3-43c79504f60b"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Collecting pymupdf\n","  Downloading PyMuPDF-1.24.1-cp310-none-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl (3.9 MB)\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m3.9/3.9 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m8.9 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25hCollecting python-docx\n","  Downloading python_docx-1.1.0-py3-none-any.whl (239 kB)\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m239.6/239.6 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m15.5 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25hCollecting PyMuPDFb==1.24.1 (from pymupdf)\n","  Downloading PyMuPDFb-1.24.1-py3-none-manylinux2014_x86_64.manylinux_2_17_x86_64.whl (30.8 MB)\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m30.8/30.8 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m28.8 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25hRequirement already satisfied: lxml>=3.1.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from python-docx) (4.9.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: typing-extensions in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from python-docx) (4.10.0)\n","Installing collected packages: python-docx, PyMuPDFb, pymupdf\n","Successfully installed PyMuPDFb-1.24.1 pymupdf-1.24.1 python-docx-1.1.0\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**2. import modules**"],"metadata":{"id":"usZeIivDZrH4"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import fitz  # PyMuPDF\n","import docx\n","from docx.shared import RGBColor\n","from docx.oxml.ns import nsdecls\n","from docx.oxml import parse_xml\n","import fitz\n","import docx"],"metadata":{"id":"VCopvdDZUo_2"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**3. script that searches for specific keywords in a PDF file and creates a Word document highlighting those keywords**\n","\n","This code is a Python script that searches for specific keywords in a PDF file and creates a Word document highlighting those keywords along with some context around them.\n","\n","1.
