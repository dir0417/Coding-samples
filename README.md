Coding is always a new learning experience. There's always something new coming out!  So its a never ending learning process.  However, I love to code.  I think it is fun. I claim not to be an expert because I always find myself going to stackflow or googling for codes and troubleshooting. But, troubleshooting is a major part of programming.
